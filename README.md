# Online Text-based Wizard

## General Outline:

Users can create a 'room' with a unique code that may be used by others.

Inside that room, users may commence a game of Wizard with real-time updates for everyone.

The interface and its input is entirely textual, e.g. `/play 5H` will play the 5 of Hearts from the player's hand. The game will display other user's moves textually as well.

The game 'engine' will keep score and disallow invalid moves.
